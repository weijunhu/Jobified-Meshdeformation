# Jobified-Meshdeformation
In this Project we are going to procedurally generate a plane and then use our mouse click input to spawn a Sphere, which will then make a nice indentation in our plane. This could be a base for some footsteps for example. (However you’d need to do that in batches as you’d quickly run out of vertices with increasing terrain size – so maybe keep that in the back of your head!).
Job System!
